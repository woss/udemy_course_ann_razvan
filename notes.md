### ANN

Training goes back and forth
Prediction only goes forward

### Layer
*input* a layer will have input vector that is as big as as number of neurons it has
*output* a layer will have ouput vector that is as big as as number of neurons it has

One of the most important things is that current layer will connect to layer infront of it so previous layer using weight matrix, it corresponds to synapses between previous layer and this layer

Layer class will hold the data
